	<p>Ah, Bridget Jones&apos;s Diary &hellip;</p> -->

	<p>When most people hear those words, they think of heinous breakups, the weight fluctuations of Renee Zellweger, and the singleton&apos;s national anthem, &apos;All By Myself.&apos;  However, I always think of awkward family gatherings, turning over a new leaf, and the undeniable chaos of being an &apos;adult.&apos;</p>

	<p>Over Columbus Day weekend, my family celebrated my Grandma Jean&apos;s milestone birthday which was wonderful, but my journey getting from my apartment here in New York to the magical land of Marin County, California was anything but.  I left at 5:30am to hop on the subway to catch my flight - but the E Train was down.  Seeing an MTA employee sitting in the booth, I asked her if I could take a different train and she literally told me to &apos;go f**k myself&apos; and continued to eat her egg sandwich while I dragged my bag up several flights of subway stairs.  Not having the energy for dealing with another MTA employee, I decided to spring for a cab - I work hard and I deserve it!</p>  

	<p>No cabs to be found.</p>

	<p>After running up and down 8th Avenue for 10 minutes ferociously searching for anything to drive me to the airport, I whip around the corner and throw my hand up after seeing a cab, who swiftly passes me as my panic really sets in.  Then, out of nowhere, a Drag Queen crossing the street observes &apos;It looks like you need a cab, honey.&apos; I asked if she would help me and she replied &apos;No, boo thang&apos; and strutted down the block.  I finally manage to find a cab and got to the airport.</p>  



	<p>The flight was easy but long and even met Jacque Pepin at the airport!  He was on my flight (he was obviously in first class) and during my 1.5 hour wait in baggage claim, I was able to introduce myself and talked for a minute. He was very kind and the whole thing kept me from being nervous about the fact that the Viewing Party started in under 4 hours and my parent&apos;s house is about an hour from SFO. However, my luck changed once I finally got my bag. I  caught the Marin Airporter just in time - the driver puts my luggage in and I board the bus - but after finding out that I didn&apos;t have cash on me for my ticket payment, the driver kicked me off the bus on the side of the airport road. If this was any other day, I would be pissed, but instead I chalk it up to becoming more and more like Bridget every day.</p>

	<p>I manage to get a cab and navigate through an hour and a half of traffic all the way back to Novato.  </p>



	<p>I immediately started making Bridget's Blue Soup and prepping the mini omelets while mom and dad help out. While the soup is simmering, I do the finishing touches on the table that my mom set and styled beautifully.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, people started to arrive, so I popped the omelets out of the oven and arranged the mini gherkins with some English cheddar and set them on the buffet for my guests to enjoy.</p>




<p>We all mingled and made the signature Spiked Thai Iced Tea cocktail and then proceeded to watch the first film.  Considering this is a one-night event, I picked my favorite of the three movies to watch, while the menu was inspired by the whole Bridget Jones Trilogy, because there's just too many amazing food moments.</p>

<p>About halfway through the film, I paused it and we all sat down for the dinner course--Blue Soup and Curried Turkey Salad Sandwiches. Both were delicious as we all discussed our favorite parts about the movie and some fun Bridget Jones trivia.</p>

<p>After everyone was finished with their main course, we set out the Ginger-Almond Cupcakes with Orange Marmalade Cream Cheese Frosting and watched the rest of the film.  These cupcakes are so yummy that people were fighting over them!</p>
