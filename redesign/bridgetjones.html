		<h3>Bridget Jones's Diary</h3>

		<p>Ah, Bridget Jones&apos;s Diary &hellip;</p>

<p>When most people hear those words, they think of heinous breakups, the weight fluctuations of Renee Zellweger, and the singleton&apos;s national anthem, &apos;All By Myself.&apos;  However, I always think of awkward family gatherings, turning over a new leaf, and the undeniable chaos of being an &apos;adult.&apos;</p>

<p>Over Columbus Day weekend, my family celebrated my Grandma Jean&apos;s milestone birthday which was wonderful, but my journey getting from my apartment here in New York to the magical land of Marin County, California was anything but.  I left at 5:30am to hop on the subway to catch my flight - but the E Train was down.  Seeing an MTA employee sitting in the booth, I asked her if I could take a different train and she literally told me to &apos;go f**k myself&apos; and continued to eat her egg sandwich while I dragged my bag up several flights of subway stairs.  Not having the energy for dealing with another MTA employee, I decided to spring for a cab - I work hard and I deserve it!</p>  

<p>No cabs to be found.</p>

<p>After running up and down 8th Avenue for 10 minutes ferociously searching for anything to drive me to the airport, I whip around the corner and throw my hand up after seeing a cab, who swiftly passes me as my panic really sets in.  Then, out of nowhere, a Drag Queen crossing the street observes &apos;It looks like you need a cab, honey.&apos; I asked if she would help me and she replied &apos;No, boo thang&apos; and strutted down the block.  I finally manage to find a cab and got to the airport.</p>  

<p>The flight was easy but long, even though we landed a half hour early (which was great, because the Viewing Party started about 4 hours later).  However, all of the luggage from the flight didn&apos;t come out for another 1.5 hours and considering my parent&apos;s house is about an hour from SFO, I was starting to get nervous.  I then catch the Marin Airporter just in time - the driver puts my luggage in and I board the bus - but after finding out that I didn&apos;t have cash on me for my ticket payment, the driver kicked me off the bus on the side of the airport road. If this was any other day, I would be pissed, but instead I chalk it up to becoming more and more like Bridget every day.</p>

<p>I manage to get a cab and navigate through an hour and a half of traffic all the way back to Novato.  </p>

<p>I immediately started making Bridget's Blue Soup and prepping the mini omelets while mom and dad help out. While the soup is simmering, I do the finishing touches on the table that my mom set and styled beautifully.</p>
